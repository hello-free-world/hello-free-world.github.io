China is the most collectivistic country. Collectivism makes people give up thinking, individuals don’t need free will in the collective, only need to obey. In ancient China, obedience was enforced through Confucian ethics. After the founding of the PRC, school education became the main way for training obedience. However, the greatest value of being a human is free will. Without free will, there is no essential difference between humans and animals. So, we must be wary of all forms of collectivism.

My Little Pony Season 5 Episode 1 and 2 is about fighting against collectivism. Every pony living in a village gave up their cutie marks and special talents, so they can achieve true friendship by being equal. But the equality is only a false appearance. In a secret talk, ponies said they desired their cutie marks back again but were scared by their leader for losing their power. In the end, ponies drove off their leader and returned to the village to celebrate getting their individuality back.

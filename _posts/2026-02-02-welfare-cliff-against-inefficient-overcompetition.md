<p>For a long time, like many others, I regarded it as an inherently unfair policy design. Around the income threshold, earning slightly more can result in the sudden loss of benefits, leaving a person worse off in total terms. This sharp discontinuity appears, at first glance, to be a flaw—if not a punishment for effort itself.</p>
<p>I only recently came to fully understand the role of the welfare cliff. Once I stopped looking at the issue purely from the perspective of <b>individual fairness</b> and instead examined <b>how competition itself is structured</b>, it became clear that the welfare cliff is not an accidental defect in incentive design. It is a deliberate institutional arrangement with a specific structural purpose.</p>
<h1>1. How Smooth Benefit Schemes Systematically Produce Overcompetition</h1>
<p>Under a system where welfare benefits are smoothly and continuously reduced as income rises, individuals will rationally tend to exert the maximum level of effort within their personal capacity, as long as the marginal return remains positive. Effort ceases to be a value-based choice and becomes a defensive necessity to avoid falling behind.</p>
<p>The problem is that such a system fails to produce meaningful stratification. Individuals with relatively low productivity—who are unlikely to achieve a substantial productivity leap regardless of additional effort—are nonetheless continuously drawn into competition. They rarely win, but they remain in the game, expanding the pool of competitors and driving down average returns.</p>
<p>As a result, effort becomes inflated, leisure is crowded out, and overcompetition is no longer a moral failure but the natural equilibrium outcome of rational behavior under a smooth incentive structure.</p>
<h1>2. The Core Function of the Welfare Cliff: Turning Futile Competition into Exit Returns</h1>
<p>The welfare cliff does not eliminate calculation or optimization. Near the threshold, individuals will inevitably assess whether additional effort is worthwhile. The critical issue, however, is not the existence of calculation, but what that calculation ultimately leads to.</p>
<p>When benefits are sharply withdrawn once income crosses a certain threshold, individuals who cannot reliably and effectively cross that threshold are confronted with a clear conclusion: continued investment of time and energy no longer constitutes a rational strategy. The system does not punish them; rather, it <b>terminates a form of competition that is predictably inefficient</b>.</p>
<p>Unlike a smooth benefit reduction scheme, the welfare cliff provides a clear and stable return to exit. By ceasing low-efficiency effort, individuals receive welfare support along with something that smooth mechanisms cannot structurally provide: predictable and recoverable leisure time. This return is not monetary, but it is real—and it is unavailable under continuously tapered benefit designs.</p>
<h1>3. Protective Removal: Avoiding Futile Competition and Releasing Time Value</h1>
<p>Under a welfare cliff regime, those who are sorted out of competition are not simply “eliminated.” They are <b>protectively removed</b> from a competition they are unlikely to win.</p>
<p>This removal has two important effects. First, it prevents individuals from continuously expending time and energy in low-return contests. Second, it directly releases leisure time, making exit itself a choice with positive value rather than a sign of failure.</p>
<p>In a smooth welfare system, such an equilibrium cannot persist. As long as effort yields even minimal marginal returns, individuals are repeatedly pulled back into competition and cannot stably disengage. The welfare cliff, by contrast, creates a clear institutional boundary that allows “stopping” to become a sustainable outcome.</p>
<h1>4. Rebuilding Real Competitive Advantages for Those Who Can Cross the Threshold</h1>
<p>Once low-efficiency competitors are diverted out of the competitive pool, the structure of competition changes. The number of participants declines, low-return extreme effort diminishes, and for those capable of achieving genuine productivity leaps, effort once again translates into stable and meaningful relative advantage.</p>
<p>In smooth benefit systems, such advantages are quickly diluted and converted into new survival requirements. Under a welfare cliff, however, these advantages are preserved. The welfare cliff does not suppress ambition; it clears away futile competition and makes effective competition possible again.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The problem with the welfare cliff is not that it introduces discontinuity, but that it is often judged solely through the lens of individual-level fairness while ignoring the structure of competition itself.</p>
<p>Its core function is to redirect effort that cannot produce substantive productivity gains back into the welfare domain, transforming exit from competition into a rational allocation of time rather than a personal failure. When futile competition is terminated and leisure is restored, effort can once again become meaningful.</p>
<p>The welfare cliff is not a policy flaw. It is an institutional gate—designed to <b>clear the field, sort participants, and restore the value of genuine competition</b>.</p>

<p>很长一段时间里，我和很多人一样，把福利断崖视为一种明显不公平的制度设计：在收入边界附近，多努力一点反而失去福利，导致总收入下降。这种不连续看起来像是制度缺陷，甚至像是对努力的惩罚。</p>
<p>直到最近我才终于想通福利断崖这个问题。当我不再从<b>个人是否被公平对待</b>的角度，而是从<b>竞争结构如何被塑造</b>的角度重新审视时，我意识到：福利断崖并不是激励设计上的失误，而是一种有明确目的的制度安排。</p>
<h1>一、平滑福利如何系统性地制造内卷</h1>
<p>在福利随收入完全平滑递减的制度下，只要额外努力仍然带来正的边际收益，个人就会倾向于在自身能力约束下不断加大投入。是否努力不再是价值选择，而是避免相对劣势的必要行为。</p>
<p>问题在于，这种机制不会形成有效分层。那些生产率较低、即便投入更多时间也难以实现实质跃迁的人，仍会被持续吸纳进竞争之中。他们无法真正胜出，却长期占据竞争空间，拉低整体回报水平，使竞争不断向低效率区间下沉。</p>
<p>在这种结构下，努力被通胀，休闲被挤压，而内卷并非道德问题，而是理性选择的自然结果。</p>
<h1>二、断崖的本质：将无效竞争转化为退出回报</h1>
<p>福利断崖并不会消除精算行为。在阈值附近，人们一定会权衡是否继续努力。但关键不在于是否存在精算，而在于精算最终指向什么结果。</p>
<p>当福利在某一收入水平被明确切断时，那些无法稳定、有效越过断崖的人，会面对一个清晰结论：继续投入时间与精力已不再构成理性选择。制度并没有惩罚他们，而是<b>通过切断激励，终止一场注定无效的竞争</b>。</p>
<p>与平滑机制不同，断崖为退出提供了明确而稳定的回报：不再进行低效率努力，转而获得福利兜底与可预期的休闲时间。这种回报并非货币性的，却真实存在，而且是平滑递减机制在结构上无法给予的。</p>
<h1>三、保护性移出：避免无效竞争，释放时间价值</h1>
<p>在断崖制度下，被分流出竞争的人，并非被简单“淘汰”，而是被从一场注定无效的竞争中<b>保护性的移出</b>。</p>
<p>这一移出具有双重意义。其一，它避免了个人在低收益博弈中持续消耗时间与精力。其二，它直接释放了休闲时间，使退出本身成为一种具有正回报的选择。</p>
<p>在平滑福利制度中，这种状态无法稳定存在。只要努力仍有哪怕极低的边际收益，个人就会被不断拉回竞争轨道，无法真正停下来。而福利断崖通过制度性的分界，使“停止竞争”成为一个可持续的均衡。</p>
<h1>四、为有效跨越者重建真实竞争优势</h1>
<p>当低效率竞争者被分流出竞争池，竞争结构随之发生变化。参与者数量下降，低效、极限式努力减少，真正能够形成生产率跃迁的人，其投入开始转化为稳定而可持续的相对优势。</p>
<p>这种优势在平滑福利体系中往往会被迅速稀释，而在断崖机制下得以保留。福利断崖并非压制奋斗，而是通过清除无效竞争，为有效竞争腾出空间。</p>
<h1>结语</h1>
<p>福利断崖的问题不在于它制造了不连续，而在于人们习惯于只从个体公平出发，而忽略了竞争结构本身。</p>
<p>它的核心作用，是将无法形成实质跃迁的努力引导至福利区间，使退出竞争不再意味着失败，而是一种理性的时间配置选择。当无效竞争被终止，休闲得以回归，真正的奋斗才重新具备意义。</p>
<p>福利断崖不是制度漏洞，而是一道用于<b>清场、分流，并重建竞争价值</b>的制度闸门。</p></div>
